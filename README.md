Self-hosted RustDesk Server as a Home Assistant addon.

## About

[RustDesk](https://rustdesk.com/) is an open-source remote desktop software, an alternative to TeamViewer and AnyDesk. It allows you to control your devices from anywhere. By self-hosting your own server, all control and security of your remote connections remain on your own network, without relying on third-party servers.

This addon installs and configures the two main components of the RustDesk server:
* **hbbs**: The ID and Signaling Server (the "brain" that manages connections).
* **hbbr**: The Relay Server (relays traffic if a direct P2P connection is not possible).

This addon is based on version **1.1.14** of RustDesk Server.

## Installation

This addon can be installed through the Home Assistant Add-on Store.

1.  Navigate to **Settings > Add-ons > Add-on Store**.
2.  Click the three-dots menu in the top-right corner and select **Repositories**.
3.  Add the URL of this repository and click **Add**.
4.  Find the "RustDesk Server" addon in the store and click **Install**.
5.  Once installed, configure it as described below before starting.

## Configuration

The addon's options can be set in the "Configuration" tab on the addon's page.

### Option: `encrypted_only`

-   **Type**: `bool` (toggle)
-   **Default value**: `true`

Controls whether the `hbbs` server will enforce end-to-end encryption for all client connections. It is strongly recommended to keep this option enabled for maximum security.

### Option: `relay_server`

-   **Type**: `str` (text)
-   **Default value**: `127.0.0.1`

This option tells your ID server (`hbbs`) the public address of your relay server (`hbbr`).

**Important:** For most setups where both services run within this addon, this option **should be left blank (`""`)**. `hbbs` will connect to the local `hbbr` automatically. The default value of `127.0.0.1` can cause issues and should be cleared.

You should only fill this in if you are using a relay server running on a separate machine.

## Network and Port Configuration

For RustDesk clients to connect to your server from outside your local network, **you must configure port forwarding** on your router.

You need to forward the following ports to the IP address of your Home Assistant machine:

| Port  | Protocol  | Service Description                                    |
| :---- | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| 21115 | TCP       | `hbbs`: Used for the NAT type test.                    |
| 21116 | TCP       | RustDesk Main Server (Signaling, WebSocket)            |
| 21116 | UDP       | RustDesk Main Server (Heartbeat, Hole Punching)        |
| 21117 | TCP       | `hbbr`: Used for the Relay services.                   |
| 21118 | TCP       | `hbbs`: Used to support web clients.                   |
| 21119 | TCP       | `hbbr`: Used to support web clients.                   |
